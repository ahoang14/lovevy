            <h3>But at that moment I felt such warmth.</h3>
            <h4>Nov 29th, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              Today was a girls' trip. K told me she has a friend (A) that
              reminds her a lot of me so we all had a little outing together.
              This could've gone one of two ways: we get along well and can jib
              jab about all the lovely likes we share, or it turns into a Black
              Swan/Hegel moment and we try to kill each other with mirror shards
              until the victor stands triumphant over the prone form of the
              other. Heh thankfully it was the former. I think I'm the black
              swan to her white; I'm a bit more mean and blunt whereas she's
              very sweet. We bought snacks and cigs (Marlboro reds), browsed
              (admired some fetuses, fetusi?), watched Fallen Angels (Wong Kar
              Wai loves his crazy bitches), and ate Pakistani food. Grateful for
              being able to hang out with K again it's been a long time. Props
              to A for being a real trooper in her big ass car driving around SF
              TT. And YES I am a neener neener outfit repeater!!!!

            <h3>Christmas in the Park</h3>
            <h4>Nov 26th, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              Another day of adventure: Holiday Edition. Why is it when I rush
              my makeup my base turns out perfect -_- . Himi and the wife picked
              me up so we could go thrifting and CITP. I must say I pulled a
              last minute killer outfit out of my ass (we will not acknowledge
              the shoes).
              <br />
              I swiped some accessories. There was this really tempting …wall
              decor? but I had to pass. And this stylish old lady said she loved
              my outfit (and she said it in a very flattering way why thank
              you).
              <br />
              Went to CITP, got some choco, and explored. I felt very holiday
              Barbie all dressed up but the stares got uncomfortable after
              awhile. And I was fucking freezing. I bumped into a woman and she
              turned to me and paused and said I was beautiful and her friends
              were complimenting my dress. And this loser looking skater guy was
              staring me down all coomer-like and said I was beautiful; I
              would’ve been flattered if he was less fucking awkward about it
              TT. It’s a little too early for CITP so the festive atmosphere
              isn’t in the air yet but it was a nice throwback.

            <h3>Pared Persimmon for Puppy</h3>
            <h4>Nov 25th, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              Today was a day to catch up with old friends. Had dimmy with T and
              boba that was 70% pearls -_- . We went on a thrift store crawl
              while we waited for everyone else. Christ curated stores are
              fucking expensive. I prefer to shift through shit for a good deal
              I’m a pro shit shifter. I get that you’re paying extra for people
              to pick the clothes for you but that’s limiting your personal
              style no? Like the main artistic merit of thrifting is that it
              forces you buy for you and not for trends.

              <br />

              We hung out at E’s after and played with his pitiful, pathetic
              dog. And K and C were ready so we pregamed and had hotpot yummers.
              Honestly drinking and hotpot don’t mix: face burning up,
              overstimulated from the noise, alc makes my appetite wobbly.
              Either way it was fun to see everybody together again :P.

              <br />

              Went back to E’s and did my costco puzzle. Amazing quality btw
              10/10 recommend. I hate puzzles with lots of empty sameness but
              this one was packed side to side with goodies.

              <br />
              To finish the night E and I watched FNAF in his car. I’ll post the
              mini review here: It’s ironic how the one horror movie that won’t
              be ragged on for using “cheap” jump scares because that’s
              literally the premise of the franchise … doesn’t have good jump
              scares. The plot was tight and cohesive, my big caveat being that
              William’s motivations as a villain weren’t explained AT ALL. I
              know the fans were already waiting for him to show up but from a
              critics perspective it’s a huge plot hole. Good child actors,
              especially the blond kid. Animatronics were…almost scary. Bonnie
              is sexy… is Bonnie a shota since he has the soul of a kid?

            <h3>Like a Bat out of Hell</h3>
            <h4>Nov 23th, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              Unexpected turn to my Thanksgiving. After the required family
              party E picked me up to do our bestie things. It was funny how our
              night swung to such different sides of the spectrum. First we got
              boba at [redacted], a bastion for the Asian youth and really
              experienced the culture of our people. And after I was like ….wait
              we can drink legally now and I chose this local dive bar. We
              walked in and there were a bunch of grizzled men and tattoos and a
              butch lesbian. And there was someone singing metal karaoke. The
              thought only occurred to me when I got home but it was very
              Deancore (eheheh). We scurried to the back like little mice; it
              was evident we didn’t fit in. I ended up summoning the courage to
              order a drink (kinda, I needed a lot of help) and do karaoke (Good
              Times, Bad times - Zeppelin).

              <br />
              Crazy funny how we didn’t get carded once even though we looked
              hella nervous and I literally had to ask a guy how to order a
              drink (he paid for me yay). It was probably some kind of reverse
              psychology: no one underage would act so blatantly lost; I’m
              pretty sure if we weren’t legal and tried to act like we knew what
              we were doing we would’ve been carded immediately. E was too pussy
              to sing with me but I sang a duet with a friend I made. I am
              honestly so great at making friends in these kind of settings. It
              helps that I’m a pretty (enough) girl but I like to think I bring
              a good dose of charisma to the table. <br />
              Compared to the downtown club/bar scene the crowd at the dive bar
              felt very close knit and welcoming I fucked with it.

              <br />
              Although… times like these I really wish I were a boy. Being a
              friendly girl really opens a lot of doors for me but I hate having
              the romantic/sexual aspect of male interactions looming over me.
              Like fuck I just want to be friends. At this point I’m good at
              ignoring it so I can have a fun time but there’s still that threat
              of coldness and to a scarier extent violence at the back of my
              head.

              <br />
              Either way it was a fun night. It was like when Spongebob and
              Patrick were trying to get into the Salty Spitoon when they
              should've been at Weenie Hut Jr's. I might come back again I feel
              like in a lot of ways that scene would suit me more than the
              clubbing scene.

            <h4>Nov 19th, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              Had to beg and plead with my sister to come to the museum with me.
              We had enough time to get through all the exhibits (small place)
              but none for the garden. And her delicate ass was so hungry we had
              to leave for food. I'll just have to go again. Haven't been here
              since high school, and haven't actually been inside since
              elementary maybe. I mostly go to art museums so nothing is older
              than say... the 1800s, so being up close and personal with
              artifacts from like 5,000 years ago was pretty mind bending. They
              added another mummy since I was there last. I would hate to be an
              ancient Egyptian noblewoman and spent all this time and money on
              my tomb, only to be put on display and gawked at for eternity in
              an airconditioned glass box. And here I will perpetual the gawkage
              by putting a picture in this entry:

              Also we both had on ludicrously clacky shoes so we were tiptoeing
              the whole time. What we sacrifice for style...

            <h3>The Hen in the Holly</h3>
            <h4>Nov 14th, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              A thrift trip today. This time to the far away land of [redacted]
              for their Savers. When the Savers closed in my city it was like
              when those coal mining towns slowly decay. The general store
              closes, unable to compete with the Walmart 30 miles down the
              mountain road. Old folks living off pittances of pensions, swaying
              and creaming on their porches. The young move away to the concrete
              crystal metropolises on the coasts while their fathers keep
              toiling away under the silt and rock. Where it’s dark and dark and
              dark and dark…. That happened metaphorically to me.
              <br />
              Anyways the prices were insane and weirdly inconsistent. But I
              picked up a few gems that will be updated in the Dollhouse. I was
              peer pressured into buying things I really wanted. No matter, I
              can punish myself now. I consider it self-flagellation - oh that’s
              hilarious when you google self-flagellation the first result is a
              crisis hotline. Imagine picking up the phone to counsel some monk
              in an abbey on the Argentinian mountainside. Hm the image of SF is
              pretty erotic… but only done in private and seen through kind of a
              vouyeristic lens. If it’s in public I’d be like jeez get a load of
              this guy. Anyways… got a really cute asymmetrical lace skirt, boho
              sweater, and fur mini coat. And my trinkets of course. I didn’t
              even glance at the book aisles I knew I wouldn’t have the
              strength. <br />Turns out Himi’s been betraying me for a long
              time… need to send her to AA. <br />Gay people are insane and
              evil.<br />
              Need to try out transformers porn again.

            <h4>Nov 8th, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              I went to see Faye Webster with my sister tonight. I'm not fan per
              se but I knew a good amount of songs and it's never a bad time to
              enjoy a show. The traffic was absolute hell getting there but so
              clean and breezy going back. I'll never get over how beautiful
              that theatre is and the crowd was filled with beautiful girls too.
              I've started to notice that venue staff have the best customer
              service, every time each worker has been so kind and congenial.
              <br />In other news... hm... I've been feeling myself retreating.
              I lot of days it feels like body is weighed down with rocks. (I
              had this idea of a torture method where the victim is laid over a
              metal grate and gets gradually pressed down through it, like those
              kitchen contraptions people cut onions with. If its a communal
              punishment then some flat surface can be laid over them and people
              can toss stones on top. And there'd have to be an "executioner" to
              arrange the stones so the weight is distributed equally. Or a
              press would be set over them and people can pay a fee for it to
              lower further and further.) <br />This scene keeps playing in my
              head where I'm laying in a clam shell and it slowly closes over me
              and I'm viewing over this omnisciently like a dream. I want to be
              shiny again. <br /><br />

              Halloweekend update~ Went out with Himimi and her boywife to go
              and bar and things and I fucking forgot my ID Himi + wife if you
              read this I'm sorryyy. Anyways sometimes I really do doubt myself
              but no I am extremely alluring and beautiful (drunk me at least)
              and men desire me...carnally. And so many pretty girls to talk to
              which is always a boon for me. <br />Will recount the rest of the
              night in snapshots: Moscow Mule, Julius Caesar, PSA - Don't do
              ketamine for the love of god, Red 40 vomit, free Tacobell. Also I
              was a kid's ladybug costume from goodwill. It's quite shameful
              actually - every year I'm very adamant about diying my costume but
              I just couldn't bring forth the motivation this year ://

              Today and yesterday was the book sale. Got held captive by the
              clerk but he also started my Faulkner journey. GGM and Cormac
              McCarthy? How could I resist his alluring pull. And this whole
              time I've been avoiding him, in part bc of his association with
              Hemingway. Woe is me tho got there too late and missed the
              Faulkner collections I saw yesterday. People were lugging books by
              the crate into their cars I had a heart attack. <br />
              <br />
              Stood on the wayside while drama was sorted, got a moderate
              shitfull of books, and had 1/2 a boba and popcorn - in conclusion
              a good day.

              There's a cat that's been coming to our balcony. I named him
              Clawde... bit of a poor decision since I already named my friend's
              animorphic thingy Clawdius. He likes to come and let out this
              really plaintive meow. Like "meeeeaaaho".
              <br />
              <br />
              Sometimes at night I want to walk all the way out to the fields
              and stay still and quiet until morning.

              A lot of what I've been reading is centered on retrospect - of
              memory and archives and looking back and bringing those things
              forward to you. Walking into the room after the gun went off. I
              don't have anything particularly profound to say, I just love how
              history and memory turn into this mangled mess through time, over
              millenia or a few years it doesn't matter. <br /><br />

              For a while I've wanted to make a site to curate all my knicks and
              knacks. The catalyst was fiddling with my laptop settings and now
              it's running near lightspeed. Though actually coding everything is
              going glacier because I'm just so damn indecisive. Ironically I'm
              struggling more with idea than execution. <br />
