            <h3>Balls and Shafts</h3>
            <h4>March-August, 2024</h4>
            <p>
              In retrospect I wish I journaled more during this time because it
              would've been cool seeing how green and bright-eyed I was compared
              to the haggard creature I've become. That sounds so ominous but -
              you'll see. I stopped updating my site for (heh...) five months
              because I've been... consumed... subsumed... masticated and
              swallowed... by the world of pool.
              <br /><br />
              In March I got a job at a pool hall, totally random online
              listing; it was either here, the bingo place across the street, or
              Din Tai Fung. And really I'm so grateful to past me for choosing
              right. Typical things: interview was norms, training was chill,
              then started working like a big girl all by myself. I started
              shooting pool a lot. Like a lot a lot. Like end an 8 hour shift
              and stay for 5 hours after. And I've had a lot of teachers
              (quality of instruction varied greatly). And I started getting to
              know regulars and coworkers. I've met a lot of really
              great/fun/cool/weird people from seriously all walks of life. For
              fear of sounding too superior I won't say I don't relate to people
              my age, it's just that I don't find many of them interesting. I
              just... really enjoy hanging out with crazily different kinds of
              people (though everyone is above 25 and 95% are guys). (And
              actually yeah my big gripe about pool is that there's so few
              women.)<br /><br />
              Quick aside: I didn't consider myself attractive until about a
              year ago, but wow working at a pool hall has inflated my ego to a
              point it's a little concerning. Ohohoho there are indeed a few
              perks that come with being young and pretty. And YES I know about
              that double-edged sword and YES I did have a brief crisis over it
              a few months ago. <br /><br />
              Anyways I have a lot of people I can genuinely call my friends
              now, quality real steel friends. But that's not what's really
              important. When it comes down to it... can I play pool? The answer
              is... complicated.

            <h3>Between the Walls</h3>
            <h4>March 1st, 2024</h4>
            <p>
              Another punk show... getting a taste of the scene, and in this
              case getting a case of the extremes. Angel asked if I wanted to go
              to another show since I dug the first so much - of course I said
              yes. I brought along my little sister (many know her as Baby)
              because she's kinda sorta I suppose alt-ish.
              <br /><br />
              To set the scene: Baby and I emerge from the underground parking,
              slight drizzle, piss smell but very typical for the area. We turn
              and walk into the venue, which is an art gallery, not DIY, and
              actual one... hm. Where the hell are the amps and the fifteen year
              olds throwing haymakers at each other. We follow the signs leading
              down a corridor, open a huge industrial looking door, and voila.
            </p>
            <img

            />
            <p>
              Just a huge empty room, barren, black curtains. I swear it felt
              like we were lab rats in some sort of hypnoaudioaggro experiment.
              And it was a fun time. Bands were awesome and the guys were just
              whaling on each other in the pit.
              <br /><br />Most surreal part of the night was in between sets
              when everyone would rush out for a smoke, there'd just be a
              shitton of these hella edgy looking kids milling around in a
              downtown art gallery amongst the "cultured". Like, the contrast
              was so stark it would be too on the nose as a joke. <br /><br />
              Also I experienced an ultimate sister betrayal from Baby but I
              shall not speak of that (fucking bitch).

            <h3>Chúc Mừng Năm Mới!</h3>
            <h4>Februrary 12th, 2024</h4>
            <p>
              Chinese new years weekend... go! <br />
              Friday: <br />Angel and I went to an electronic show in SF and no
              not Illenium or EDC but the shit they play to CIA captives to make
              them go insane. I physically can't listen to whatever genre this
              is sober and/or alone in my room but buzzed and in a sweaty crowd
              it's so fun! It was my first time going to anything like this but
              now I should keep an eye out for events. And really I was only
              slightly buzzed for most of the night (although I got my poppers
              cherry popped! Yipeeee!) but it was still awesome. I love to dance
              and I love to be apart of Movement. Watching people (many of them
              strange looking) completely immersed in themselves and moving to
              the music (really funny seeing everyone jumping up and down but
              completely out of sync). The last set was nonstop bangers and
              Angel and I were just /in it/ (with the assistance of [redacted]).
              <br /><br />
              Saturday:<br />
              Rest. For once CNY fell on a weekend so my mom and I just knew it
              would be wall to wall packed and honestly we didn't want to deal
              with the parking, especially walking in my nine inch heels. Though
              I wish I wore ao dai this year. <br /><br />Sunday: Another show
              but this time it was punk... think the term is HXC and I went with
              Angel and her friend Mori. Another very drastic first for me, big
              leaps! This show was even better! In the thick of the crowd you
              just get shoved around and pummeled to no end and there's sweaty
              white guys with long hair crushing you. I got kicked in the legs,
              I got nearly trampled, I got kicked in the face, my top (wholly
              held together by a combination of string and safety pins) popped
              open, I stage dove (many times), no idea what the lyrics were but
              I screamed along anyways. <br /><br />Monday: <br />
              A quiet day of chua hopping with my mom. Took lots of cutie
              pictures of her, prayed, ate chua food - yummers, went to the
              cemetery, prayed, looked at old gravestones with her.

            <h3>Yesterday Haze</h3>
            <h4>Februrary 3rd, 2024</h4>
            <p>
              If there's one thing I didn't know I needed to check off my
              bucketlist, it's going to the three story Applebee's at the wharf.
              <br />
              Backtracking... I hang out with Mimi and her wife a lot and it's
              made me come to a realization: I love being a third wheel. I get
              to enjoy all the tralala and teehee of love while staying at arms
              reach; it's an ideal situation for me honestly. Actually an ideal
              situation is to be in a throuple except I don't engage in the
              couple-ing nor the coupling. Ok so went to sf with the wife to
              pick up Mimi, then sandwich, perfume, ciggy, sex shop to see a
              vibrator museum (to my dismay it was more literal vibrators than
              the fun kind), and the wharf. My god do I love the Musée
              Mécanique. There's no other place that encapsulates my soul as
              well as it (only thing I would add is a smoke shop in the
              backroom).
              <br />
              I love Applebee's I don't CARE what anyone says. 2 for 25 with a
              like $7 cocktail the size of a fishbowl cmon man. And yes I nearly
              got sloshed. The view was beautiful. It's raining and the streets
              are empty and the lights are reflecting every way and we're
              sitting above the huge ass Applebee's sign. And then we trekked
              that long long road to the pier. Keep in mind the rain's falling
              harder and I'm in half-broken Mary Janes and a dress. And we get
              the the pier and there's that horribly beautiful roar of the
              ocean. Just thunderous like you wouldn't believe. It's freezing
              and wet and no one's around but the lights are still brilliant and
              it's like walking through Disneyland in a dream. And the people
              that pass by I'm asking them Are you real? Are you real? Are you
              real?

            <h3>The Phantom Rickshaw</h3>
            <h4>Janurary 27th, 2024</h4>
            <p>
              Been doing a lot of antiquing lately now that I finally know where
              to go. Against my better judgement - who am I kidding I was
              totally down - I bought not one but two porno mags. One day I'll
              have big boy money to buy all the crazy shit I want, like a
              loveseat... or a gun. I think growing up in the tech mecca has
              come to make me disdain anything new and shiny. Something in me
              wants roots deep in the ground. I want ancestors who touched this
              soil and to have a necklace my great great grandmother wore. I
              remember being a kid at the cemetery and seeing tombstones from
              the 1800s and just aching.

            <h3>A stone's throw</h3>
            <h4>December 2023</h4>
            <p>
              December was largely spent with my scattered friends. Honestly I
              missed them so much I was dreading the days they left. Got covid.
              Recovered. A lot of days passed with Yuuri, lot of bars, freezing
              movie dates (ew), a quick jaunt around a museum - standing at the
              Gates of Hell, a really impressive Tom Ford salesman, and of
              course some crossdressing. Puzzlemania has hit the twin towers
              i.e. Kay and I. And we're together again and I love her. I long
              awaited Killua reunion. A long awaited CAKE, a singing CAKE - well
              I already knew but karaoke is fucking killer. And I love them. I
              wish I could take a snapshot of us together in school and now, and
              print them both out on vellum and overlay them. Hold it up to the
              light.

            <h3>But at that moment I felt such warmth.</h3>
            <h4>Nov 29th, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              Today was a girls' trip. K told me she has a friend (A) that
              reminds her a lot of me so we all had a little outing together.
              This could've gone one of two ways: we get along well and can jib
              jab about all the lovely likes we share, or it turns into a Black
              Swan/Hegel moment and we try to kill each other with mirror shards
              until the victor stands triumphant over the prone form of the
              other. Heh thankfully it was the former. I think I'm the black
              swan to her white; I'm a bit more mean and blunt whereas she's
              very sweet. We bought snacks and cigs (Marlboro reds), browsed
              (admired some fetuses, fetusi?), watched Fallen Angels (Wong Kar
              Wai loves his crazy bitches), and ate Pakistani food. Grateful for
              being able to hang out with K again it's been a long time. Props
              to A for being a real trooper in her big ass car driving around SF
              TT. And YES I am a neener neener outfit repeater!!!!

            <h3>Merry Tidings</h3>
            <h4>Nov 26th, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              Another day of adventure: Holiday Edition. Why is it when I rush
              my makeup my base turns out perfect -_- . Himi and the wife picked
              me up so we could go thrifting and CITP. I must say I pulled a
              last minute killer outfit out of my ass (we will not acknowledge
              the shoes).
              <br />
              I swiped some accessories. There was this really tempting …wall
              decor? but I had to pass. And this stylish old lady said she loved
              my outfit (and she said it in a very flattering way why thank
              you).
              <br />
              Went to CITP, got some choco, and explored. I felt very holiday
              Barbie all dressed up but the stares got uncomfortable after
              awhile. And I was fucking freezing. I bumped into a woman and she
              turned to me and paused and said I was beautiful and her friends
              were complimenting my dress. And this loser looking skater guy was
              staring me down all coomer-like and said I was beautiful; I
              would’ve been flattered if he was less fucking awkward about it
              TT. It’s a little too early for CITP so the festive atmosphere
              isn’t in the air yet but it was a nice throwback.

            <h3>Pared Persimmon for Puppy</h3>
            <h4>Nov 25th, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              Today was a day to catch up with old friends. Had dimmy with T and
              boba that was 70% pearls -_- . We went on a thrift store crawl
              while we waited for everyone else. Christ curated stores are
              fucking expensive. I prefer to shift through shit for a good deal
              I’m a pro shit shifter. I get that you’re paying extra for people
              to pick the clothes for you but that’s limiting your personal
              style no? Like the main artistic merit of thrifting is that it
              forces you buy for you and not for trends.

              <br />

              We hung out at E’s after and played with his pitiful, pathetic
              dog. And K and C were ready so we pregamed and had hotpot yummers.
              Honestly drinking and hotpot don’t mix: face burning up,
              overstimulated from the noise, alc makes my appetite wobbly.
              Either way it was fun to see everybody together again :P.

              <br />

              Went back to E’s and did my costco puzzle. Amazing quality btw
              10/10 recommend. I hate puzzles with lots of empty sameness but
              this one was packed side to side with goodies.

              <br />
              To finish the night E and I watched FNAF in his car. I’ll post the
              mini review here: It’s ironic how the one horror movie that won’t
              be ragged on for using “cheap” jump scares because that’s
              literally the premise of the franchise … doesn’t have good jump
              scares. The plot was tight and cohesive, my big caveat being that
              William’s motivations as a villain weren’t explained AT ALL. I
              know the fans were already waiting for him to show up but from a
              critics perspective it’s a huge plot hole. Good child actors,
              especially the blond kid. Animatronics were…almost scary. Bonnie
              is sexy… is Bonnie a shota since he has the soul of a kid?

            <h3>Like a Bat out of Hell</h3>
            <h4>Nov 23th, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              Unexpected turn to my Thanksgiving. After the required family
              party E picked me up to do our bestie things. It was funny how our
              night swung to such different sides of the spectrum. First we got
              boba at [redacted], a bastion for the Asian youth and really
              experienced the culture of our people. And after I was like ….wait
              we can drink legally now and I chose this local dive bar. We
              walked in and there were a bunch of grizzled men and tattoos and a
              butch lesbian. And there was someone singing metal karaoke. The
              thought only occurred to me when I got home but it was very
              Deancore (eheheh). We scurried to the back like little mice; it
              was evident we didn’t fit in. I ended up summoning the courage to
              order a drink (kinda, I needed a lot of help) and do karaoke (Good
              Times, Bad times - Zeppelin).

              <br />
              Crazy funny how we didn’t get carded once even though we looked
              hella nervous and I literally had to ask a guy how to order a
              drink (he paid for me yay). It was probably some kind of reverse
              psychology: no one underage would act so blatantly lost; I’m
              pretty sure if we weren’t legal and tried to act like we knew what
              we were doing we would’ve been carded immediately. E was too pussy
              to sing with me but I sang a duet with a friend I made. I am
              honestly so great at making friends in these kind of settings. It
              helps that I’m a pretty (enough) girl but I like to think I bring
              a good dose of charisma to the table. <br />
              Compared to the downtown club/bar scene the crowd at the dive bar
              felt very close knit and welcoming I fucked with it.

              <br />
              Although… times like these I really wish I were a boy. Being a
              friendly girl really opens a lot of doors for me but I hate having
              the romantic/sexual aspect of male interactions looming over me.
              Like fuck I just want to be friends. At this point I’m good at
              ignoring it so I can have a fun time but there’s still that threat
              of coldness and to a scarier extent violence at the back of my
              head.

              <br />
              Either way it was a fun night. It was like when Spongebob and
              Patrick were trying to get into the Salty Spitoon when they
              should've been at Weenie Hut Jr's. I might come back again I feel
              like in a lot of ways that scene would suit me more than the
              clubbing scene.

            <p>
              Had to beg and plead with my sister to come to the museum with me.
              We had enough time to get through all the exhibits (small place)
              but none for the garden. And her delicate ass was so hungry we had
              to leave for food. I'll just have to go again. Haven't been here
              since high school, and haven't actually been inside since
              elementary maybe. I mostly go to art museums so nothing is older
              than say... the 1800s, so being up close and personal with
              artifacts from like 5,000 years ago was pretty mind bending. They
              added another mummy since I was there last. I would hate to be an
              ancient Egyptian noblewoman and spent all this time and money on
              my tomb, only to be put on display and gawked at for eternity in
              an airconditioned glass box. And here I will perpetual the gawkage
              by putting a picture in this entry:

              Also we both had on ludicrously clacky shoes so we were tiptoeing

            <h4>Nov 14th, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              A thrift trip today. This time to the far away land of [redacted]
              for their Savers. When the Savers closed in my city it was like
              when those coal mining towns slowly decay. The general store
              closes, unable to compete with the Walmart 30 miles down the
              mountain road. Old folks living off pittances of pensions, swaying
              and creaming on their porches. The young move away to the concrete
              crystal metropolises on the coasts while their fathers keep
              toiling away under the silt and rock. Where it’s dark and dark and
              dark and dark…. That happened metaphorically to me.
              <br />
              Anyways the prices were insane and weirdly inconsistent. But I
              picked up a few gems that will be updated in the Dollhouse. I was
              peer pressured into buying things I really wanted. No matter, I
              can punish myself now. I consider it self-flagellation - oh that’s
              hilarious when you google self-flagellation the first result is a
              crisis hotline. Imagine picking up the phone to counsel some monk
              in an abbey on the Argentinian mountainside. Hm the image of SF is
              pretty erotic… but only done in private and seen through kind of a
              vouyeristic lens. If it’s in public I’d be like jeez get a load of
              this guy. Anyways… got a really cute asymmetrical lace skirt, boho
              sweater, and fur mini coat. And my trinkets of course. I didn’t
              even glance at the book aisles I knew I wouldn’t have the
              strength. <br />Turns out Himi’s been betraying me for a long
              time… need to send her to AA. <br />Gay people are insane and
              evil.<br />

            <h4>Nov 8th, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              I went to see Faye Webster with my sister tonight. I'm not fan per
              se but I knew a good amount of songs and it's never a bad time to
              enjoy a show. The traffic was absolute hell getting there but so
              clean and breezy going back. I'll never get over how beautiful
              that theatre is and the crowd was filled with beautiful girls too.
              I've started to notice that venue staff have the best customer
              service, every time each worker has been so kind and congenial.
              <br />In other news... hm... I've been feeling myself retreating.
              I lot of days it feels like body is weighed down with rocks. (I
              had this idea of a torture method where the victim is laid over a
              metal grate and gets gradually pressed down through it, like those
              kitchen contraptions people cut onions with. If its a communal
              punishment then some flat surface can be laid over them and people
              can toss stones on top. And there'd have to be an "executioner" to
              arrange the stones so the weight is distributed equally. Or a
              press would be set over them and people can pay a fee for it to
              lower further and further.) <br />This scene keeps playing in my
              head where I'm laying in a clam shell and it slowly closes over me
              and I'm viewing over this omnisciently like a dream. I want to be
              shiny again. <br /><br />

              Today and yesterday was the book sale. Got held captive by the
              clerk but he also started my Faulkner journey. GGM and Cormac
              McCarthy? How could I resist his alluring pull. And this whole
              time I've been avoiding him, in part bc of his association with
              Hemingway. Woe is me tho got there too late and missed the
              Faulkner collections I saw yesterday. People were lugging books by
              the crate into their cars I had a heart attack. <br />
              <br />
              Stood on the wayside while drama was sorted, got a moderate
              shitfull of books, and had 1/2 a boba and popcorn - in conclusion
              a good day.

            <p>
              There's a cat that's been coming to our balcony. I named him
              Clawde... bit of a poor decision since I already named my friend's
              animorphic thingy Clawdius. He likes to come and let out this
              really plaintive meow. Like "meeeeaaaho".
              <br />
              <br />
              Sometimes at night I want to walk all the way out to the fields
              and stay still and quiet until morning.
              <br />
              <br />

              A lot of what I've been reading is centered on retrospect - of
              memory and archives and looking back and bringing those things
              forward to you. Walking into the room after the gun went off. I
              don't have anything particularly profound to say, I just love how
              history and memory turn into this mangled mess through time, over
              millenia or a few years it doesn't matter. <br /><br />

              For a while I've wanted to make a site to curate all my knicks and
              knacks. The catalyst was fiddling with my laptop settings and now
              it's running near lightspeed. Though actually coding everything is
              going glacier because I'm just so damn indecisive. Ironically I'm
              struggling more with idea than execution. <br />
