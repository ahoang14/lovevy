                If there’s one thing Charlie Rose will do it’s get his point
                across and I say this derogatorily. Yeah he’s charismatic and
                asks engaging questions but the way he goes about it … it’s
                ironic for the line of work he’s in that he has such meandering
                and unclear wording. It feels like he’s prioritizing sounding
                intellectual over planning out his line of questioning. He does
                that thing where he starts asking a question and his guest will
                get the gist and start answering but he just had to finish what
                he’s saying first. Surprisingly unaccommodating. <br />Anyways I
                love Harold Bloom. I love his snobbery (in that we are kin) and
                that he has the intellect to back it up. Do I agree with
                everything he says, obviously not but I admire his balls. He
                says the shit he wants to say. Though it was easier back then, I
                don’t wanna know how the pc crowd would react if he was alive
                today. I think he’d keel over and die (again) if he saw the
                state of personal taste and media literacy we have today. I’ll
                need to lookup on if he had any thoughts on how consumerism has
                affected our perception of quality. I sure have a lot. RIP Mr.
                Bloom.

              <p>
                I've been watching a lot of old talk shows especially Dick
                Cavett and Johnny Carson. Not so much Carson because idk most of
                his guests ://. Favorite guests: Orson Welles, Hitchcock, and
                Groucho Marx. I truly despise modern talk show hosts now that I
                know what we used to have. <br />
                Awhile ago I really enjoyed Charlie Rose interviews but my
                opinion of him has since soured. Something I really loved was
                watching his sessions with Susan Sontag and Joan Didion back to
                back. Sontag being very assertive and almost regal whereas
                Didion was like a stuttering bird I wanted to hold in my palm.
                God brilliant, brilliant women.

              <p>
                Wow Baldwin has such an engaging cadence to his voice. I don't
                necessarily identify as an "artist" but by Baldwin's definition
                I am a sufferer. What he's saying here is that artists bridge
                the gap, the untranslatable, of what the whole of humanity
                feels. Whether they do it well or not doesn't matter but what
                does is if someone else was on the other side to connect. This
                does make me wonder what role reclusive artists play in this
                exchange. I think about

                a lot. Before his work was discovered, was its only value
                whatever joy and fulfillment it brought Hampton? And what about
                the betrayal of blasting out something so clearly private to
                him?
