                <p>
                  Bangerrrrr. Gut-twisting mix of body, cosmic, and folk horror
                  and there's genuinely terrifying imagery on all three fronts.
                  The scene in the village will stay with me for a long time.
                  Folk horror is truly one of my favorite genres; it spans
                  esoteric and forgotten parts of culture so that it doesn't
                  fall into the usual tropes than Christian horror does but
                  still has a canon that one can ground themselves to.
                  <br />
                  America is very squeamish about showing child
                  death/gore/mutilation etc. on screen but apparently Taiwan is
                  not :). The little twist at the end is corny but a cute little
                  stab at audience inclusion. My only complaint is that the
                  found footage style made me nauseous less than halfway through
                  but that's a normal occurrence.

                <p>
                  Did not expect this to be as good as it was. The pacing was
                  great, there's a good creep into "oh no we're trapped"
                  territory and then all out terror and mayhem for the final
                  act. It also balances the monsters with the intergroup
                  girl-drama well. It's rare for a horror movie to have an all
                  female cast that aren't schoolgirls. This group is written
                  like a real group of female friends and not guys with the
                  pronouns switched. And there's the fun addition of an open
                  ending.

                <p>
                  I... honestly don't know what to say. To preface I came into
                  this movie and Tarkovsky's oeuvre completely blind and I
                  watched this movie sleep-deprived (with contacts on) in a
                  crowded theatre. It was... an experience... not a fun one. I
                  got the gist of the concept Tarkovsky was trying to portray
                  but I was really not in the mood for it. And by the time the
                  candle scene went on, that long, long candle scene, I had
                  mentally clocked out.

                <h4>Possum (2018)</h4>
                <p>
                  This was a late night car movie with E. This has a simple "the
                  monster is a representation of trauma" plot but for some
                  reason E and I were convinced that is was way more convuluted.
                  The acting, atmosphere, and the monster (wow) itself were all
                  very well done. Though I will say,Gruelingly slow pacing and
                  editing. Disgustingly slow actually. I'm all for creeping
                  atmosphere but the chunks of minute long shots of English
                  countryside was starting to get grating. What redeems this
                  movie is the fucking terrifying monster Possum. I had seen
                  screencaps of Mr. Possum for years on tumblr and every time
                  the sight of him would shock my very foundations. There's a
                  chase scene in the climax that is truly sphincter-tightening.
                  Overall it was a good opportunity to skriek in E's ear.

                  Beautiful, beautiful women, beautiful color palette, beautiful
                  motion. Most unhurried movie I’ve ever seen. It’s like that
                  saying idle hands are something something about the devil. If
                  Galoup had Grindr or a war to fight he wouldn’t be needing to
                  resort to murder, which I suppose u can say about most men. I
                  almost envy Galoup for his…not blindness or ignorance to his
                  attraction but like complete inability to even fathom it. It’s
                  like a dog chasing it’s own tail. What can I say I love the
                  way men love.

                  At the request of Angel I went into this viewing completely
                  blind. It was a gorgeous and goofy and dreamlike
                  (nightmarish?) experience. The set design and lighting
                  reminded me a lot of James Bidgood's work. It's a big jump
                  into the fantastical; the actors are all paperdolls of people,
                  and the backdrops are lavish with every prop precisely placed.
                  The friendship of the girls really tugged on my heart; I miss
                  being blissful and beautiful and surrounded by the ones I
                  love. And of course I loved the chaos of it all, I loved that
                  white chiffon scarf writhing in the wind, I loved that
                  dusk-lit sky blazing in the background, I loved that sea of
                  red and its tumbling bodies.

                <h4>Trolls 3 (2023)</h4>
                <p>
                  Not ashamed to say this was my best viewing experience of
                  2023. I vaguely knew Trolls was really popular with kids but
                  my god did I underestimate it. Watched 3 and 2 in that order
                  with my sister. I can say within the first 5 minutes I was
                  hooked. Took us twice as long to get through the movie because
                  we had to pause and rewind to rave and giggle and look up the
                  VAs. Everyone touts Puss and Spiderverse as the pinnacle of
                  modern animation but Trolls deserves its flowers too!! There
                  were so many brain/tingling textures and compositions and
                  experimental mixed media scenes it was so fucking cool. And
                  the music- god the music. I’ve been playing the soundtrack to
                  both nonstop. You can tell so much love and effort and detail
                  was put into every aspect musically and visually. I really
                  with I was a five year old so I could stim to these movies
                  everyday. Side note: it’s kinda funny how you can tell what
                  micro-era Trolls 2 belongs to because of the super intense
                  bokeh effects. It falls into the same group with Soul and Toy
                  Story 4. You can tell that was the big new development in
                  animation tech from how loaded these films are with it. AND
                  MR. DINKLES. FAVORITE LITTLE THING OF ALL TIME HE’S MY NEW
                  GOD.

                <h4>Fallen Angels (1995)</h4>
                <p>
                  It’s been a while since I’ve Wong Kar Wai-ed. This is the
                  second time I’ve seen a movie in an artsy theatre (first was
                  Skinamarink: banger). I haven’t seen this movie since middle
                  school so I have no memory of it really. I’m going to assume
                  Angels came after Chungking because it’s a lot more
                  experimental - honestly a little too much for my taste. I’ve
                  been trying to watch more art house but honestly there’s only
                  so long I can look at swirling colors and slow pans before my
                  brain needs plot stimuli. But the gritty Hong Kongian
                  aesthetic so appeals to me so it wasn’t a slog to watch (and I
                  could stare at Takeshi Kaneshiro’s face for millennia, thought
                  he's cuter in Chungking imo). The assistant’s scenes felt like
                  one long perfume commercial; that is neither a positive nor
                  negative. I’ve noticed that WKW likes to use the ships passing
                  in the night motif: two characters in the same place at
                  different times. And really that represents what much of his
                  work is about : missed and lost and mourned connections,
                  isolation in the maddening crowd. And god the setting is a
                  character in and of itself. You wouldn’t be able to have these
                  films in bumfuck Iowa; there needs to be the bustle and the
                  grime and the feeling of grazing someone’s shoulder on a busy
                  street. Game that will get your stomach pumped: Drink
                  everytime someone smokes a cigarette.

                <p>
                  Why did I subject myself to this...<br />Amazingly my sister
                  told me about this documentary and its premise immediately
                  enthralled me: a look through the eyes of NYC blogger
                  "Confessions of a Bareback Cunt". It was hilarious to me how
                  the movie opens up with not one, not two, but three
                  hard-hitting quotes to frame what is essentially a hardcore
                  porno. <br />
                  As I expected I was more fascinated than disgusted by the
                  cumdump's lifestyle. It was interesting to me how jaded he
                  was. You'd think living this far-spectrum hedonist lifestyle
                  would make a guy more happy-go-lucky.
                  <br />
                  Christ I would've really benefitted from some subtitles.
                  Whatever voice modulator the director used made everyone sound
                  like aliens on siliconcrystalline meth. During the long fuck
                  scenes I discovered playing it 2x speed was super funny.<br />
                  I'll never fully understand the mind of a cumdump but I admire
                  their commitment to the bit.

                <h4>Tropic Thunder (2008)</h4>
                <p>
                  Why did we as a society abandon Tropic Thunder. I get that
                  “full retard” has knocked it down a peg or two in the annals
                  of history but really it deserves to be on the same level of
                  cultural reverence as 21 Jumpstreet at least. They really
                  don’t make all out blockbuster comedies anymore. In fact they
                  don’t even make parodic comedies anymore. Hollywood just takes
                  itself too seriously now I guess. Actually I'm not putting
                  this all on Hollywood because audiences have gotten too
                  pretentious to enjoy lowbrow comedy. I’m not even a fan of the
                  genre but I’ve noticed the difference from the 2000s to now.
                  It’s gotten wittier, less referential; we’ve lost the art of
                  the fart joke.
                  <br />Onto the movie itself: They really went full throttle
                  with this one. Decked out cast, explosions and shootouts,
                  racistly exotic setting, blackface, insane plot, and balls to
                  the wall performances. Like they were really going for
                  blockbuster here. <br />I love movies of angry men shouting at
                  each other. Everyone is caked in shit and blood and glycerin
                  and swinging their tiny dicks around and screaming their heads
                  off; it’s like watching a men zoo. And of course the inherent
                  homoeroticism of being war brothers. I actually wished they
                  pushed the gay element harder in those scenes. <br />I
                  genuinely think this is the best performance of RDJ’s career.
                  At one point he was an American actor playing an Australian
                  one playing a black man playing a Chinese peasant farmer.
                  That’s a four tier acting inception. Side note: did they get
                  Toby Maguire to play his gay lover because they already had a
                  movie where they fucked?
                  <br />
                  Tom Cruise on the other hand I think was miscast. The novelty
                  alone of Tom Cruise being there was funny enough but it faded
                  quick. I don’t think he had the comedic chops for that roll.

                <p>
                  Big credits to whoever did the sfx that was fuck nasty. That
                  neighbor woman is one of the most annoying personalities I've
                  ever seen on screen. I couldn't figure out if she was a woman
                  with short hair on an extremely effeminate man and that just
                  irked me even more. The casting of the artist was spot on he
                  seemed like such a timid soul. Surprisingly touching and
                  romantic story. Combined with all the errotically grotesque
                  writhing and seeping its a fun flick.

                <h4>Carrie (1776)</h4>
                <p>
                  Oh fuck I forgot how good this movie is. Its greatness brought
                  into further contrast by how ass the remake (2013) is - which
                  I watched immediately after. They say we live in a freer, more
                  sexually open society than the days of yore but which version
                  had a steamy room of "teenage" girls with their tits hanging
                  out? Yeah I thought so. I haven't read the book so I don't
                  know if the addition of Carrie practicing her powers is in
                  there but it feels so contrived. Takes away all the terror
                  when she's stupidly miming like the Scarlett Witch. Also no
                  fucking subtlety in Mortez's performance. Her weird mouth
                  quivering got grating quick. And the way she played Carrie
                  with such malice in the end... no subtlety.... <br />
                  Anyways getting sidetracked this is about 1976. I saw it years
                  ago before I could truly appreciate it but now.... I think I
                  have a crush on Sissy Spacek. She's my Shelley Duvall. My true
                  scream queen. This is one of the few times a botched nose job
                  actually elevated a performance. Her face is so ethereal and
                  uncanny I'm in love. Combined with her performance it felt
                  like Carrie was a second away from fading into the ether -
                  just a pale wisp barely on the corporeal plane. <br />
                  What I feel comparing classics to their remakes is similar to
                  how I feel about retro(1970-2000s) vs modern porn. There's
                  just no heart in media nowadays, no rawness, no spit and sweat
                  and semen.
