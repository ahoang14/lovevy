              What the hell do i write here <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              Update: Ok ig I'll just put ramblings here for now
              <br /><br />
              ~ I feel like by forcing myself to write about my thoughts I'm
              getting better at forming them, I'm pretty bad at writing and even
              worse at succinctly collecting my ideas so this site is a form of
              exposure therapy. I swear the first readings entry took twice as
              long to write as buried giant. I'm too much of a flim flam floppy
              writer.
              <br /><br />
              ~ dare I make a wincest shrine... no i yet possess the power
              <br /><br />
              ~ really need to put together a music page but im worried my setup
              is getting repetitive. maybe i could do smt similar to the parlor
              layout
              <br /><br />
              ~ lw not feeling my splash page anymore needs a change.. too
              reminiscent of an earlier time. looking at other people's sites is
              bringing into stark contrast my lack of vision. i am just not. a
              creative. person.
