            <h3>Geek Love ~ Katherine Dunn</h3>
            <p>
              I've been in quite the reading slump lately and this is what
              brought me out of it. Firstly, the prose was amazing. It was
              colorful and vulgar and strange and unrelenting. There were so
              many small snippets of detail that blended the mundane and
              extravagant. It was like a world flipped upside down, the
              beautiful turned taboo and the taboo turned beautiful.
              <br /><br />

              The story revels in the horror and absurdity of freak shows
              instead of trying to rationalize it. Arty is a monstrous
              megalomaniac but through the eyes of Oly I found myself falling in
              love with him with her. Even though the setting is transient, the
              backwaters and metropolises of America fall away, like the family
              all that's worth remembering is their home, their nexus, their
              carnival. The great love story of the Binewskis is what takes
              center stage. <br /><br />There's such a complicated dynamic of
              love and power and pity and hatred between all the members of the
              family, but I think the inherent absurdity of their lives as
              freaks made their family issues less melodramatic and more
              realistically painful. It felt like their fates were doomed from
              the start.

            <h3>Big Red Son ~ David Foster Wallace</h3>
            <h4>Jan 28, 2024</h4>
            <p>
              This is my first DFW though of course Infinite Jest has been on my
              to-read purely to sate the redditor gremlin on my shoulder. I
              deeply envious of writers like him, ear-to-the-ground and deeply
              immersed and connected to the thrumming heart of Us and so so
              witty. I have a running list of essayists in my head whose eyes I
              want to steal; I want to live in their brains like a fly.
              <br /><br />There's this general awe mixed with trepidation imbued
              in the culture of the 90s to the early aughts (I wasn't even
              cognizant then so I'm gleaning this from whatever media has
              crossed over the barrier of time to me). It's the dawn of the
              millennia and every thing is shiny and chrome but it's sullied by
              the big FEAR - fear of the machine, fear of ourselves, fear of
              what we've done to each other. It's like everyone is standing
              agape at this rogue wave hoping it doesn't come crashing down on
              them. <br /><br />
              I think DFW would be satisfied/horrified to find how prescient his
              piece is. Let's see: Celebrity culture? Check. Increasing
              commodification of women? Check. Spiraling descent into filth and
              abasement? Check. He couldn't have predicted the horror that is AI
              and deepfake though - or those insane Terminator fleshlights. And
              I'm glad to report he was wrong about snuff going mainstream.

              Came across these beautiful watercolors of a black man and saw the
              artist was John Singer Sargent and I was like ??wahhh?? Turns out
              the story behind Sargent and this muse contains complicated
              intersections of race, class, sexuality, and artistry - very juicy
              stuff.

              How far back does this macabre spectacle go? Did early humans
              revel in watching a saber tooth tiger down a mammoth? I think they
              did. Life is more interesting on the edge - or in this case
              viewing life from the edge is more interesting. Also I just love
              how comically dramatic the Victorians were. Any hint of the gothic
              and they’re there.

            <h3>The Buried Giant ~ Kazuo Ishiguro</h3>
            <h4>Nov 14, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              I was scared of returning to Kazuo Ishiguro because of how badly
              disappointed I was in Never Let Me Go. But The Buried Giant was a
              novel I unexpectedly loved. 1. Because of my aforementioned
              experience 2. Because its a very capital E English fantasy. I
              don't even remember the last time I read a typical fantasy novel
              and with the dystopian I just read it seems like I'm on a genre
              tour. Maybe I'll read a pulp western next to round everything out.
              <br /><br />
              The Buried Giant doesn't seem like a typical fantasy to me though.
              The tone of it reminds me of magical realism works in that the
              fantastical elements read as so prosaic (it helps that I know next
              to nothing about Arthurian England) that I can fully believe back
              then ogres and pixies and dragons really did live amongst people.
              <br />
              <br />
              As for the setting and dialogue it took very little time to get
              immersed in both. I love a good craggy outlook and rolling
              hillside. The dialogue reminded me a bit of Shakespeare? In that
              kind of overexplaining quaint way his characters speak. Like a
              cross between Shakespeare and fairytale. I loved the dialogue
              actually.
              <br />
              <br />
              The cast was similar to Piranesi in a way. They're one-dimensional
              like characters from a fairytale. And therefore very pure and
              guileless. This pastoral background combined with these kind and
              noble characters made it all the more shocking when scenes of
              violence and cruelty happen. At first it was laced in but as the
              plot started materializing it became central to the story.
              Absolutely heartbroken by Axl and Beatrice. Good simple characters
              with a lived in love. Their devotion to each other... I did cry at
              the end. Actually I was on the verge of tears for the last few
              chapters.
              <br /><br />
              This book restored my faith in Ishiguro. The way the plot threads
              weaved together in the end was so graceful and just so well put
              together. And his message of war and forgiveness and revenge and
              death was so poignant... There was no villian in this story. It
              pulling between people trying to cope with their loyalty and anger
              and loss.

              <br /><br />
              Sidenote: the warrior took on this really erotic image in my head
              so I was getting distracted every time he showed up...

            <h3>Folding Beijing ~ Hao Jingfang</h3>
            <h4>Nov 13, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              I think this was the first thing in my reading list when I got my
              first phone. It’s a straightforward story about class inequality
              told through a dystopian setting (what’s new). I love the premise,
              the Inception-like contortion of the city is such an awesome,
              impossible image. And I tend to like these papery main characters
              like Lao Dao - ones that aren’t fighting to move the plot along
              but are instead conduits used to feel out the world. These kinds
              of characters are rare in American lit, which says a lot about our
              societal ideals lmao.

            <h3>The Library of Babel ~ Jorge Luis Borges</h3>
            <h4>Nov 11, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              A continuation of my infinite space readings. This is my first
              Borges and tbh at times I found the text near inscrutable. The
              main gist is clear, though I don’t follow the logic in the
              narrator’s thinking that the library is infinite therefore
              periodic. I enjoyed the cult-ish parts the most. It’s so pathetic
              yet noble of humans to devote their lives to a pursuit so
              impossible. I may get to the rest of Ficciones after my next read.

            <h3>Piranesi ~ Susanna Clarke</h3>
            <h4>Nov 10, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              Incredibly stunning book. I wanted to read it all in one sitting
              but I didn't want it to end so soon. But I think the short length
              was perfect. There's enough time to sit and stew in the
              world-building but the plot moves fast enough to always keep the
              reader unmoored.
              <br /><br />
              Firstly the setting: on a sliding scale for books about infinite
              homes Piranesi and House of Leaves are on complete opposite ends
              (I've been wanting to reread HoL but I don't remember where the
              fuck I put my copy -_-). The House in Piranesi is so beautiful
              because of its contradictions: the austerity and nobility of the
              statues that are eroded by the tides and desecrated by birds, the
              vast and looming power of the waves and clouds that are contained
              within mere halls and windows. It's an almost disconcerting blend
              of nature and architecture - the flowing and the rigid.
              (Unstoppable force vs immovable object anyone?) But the narrator
              has such a reverence for the House it's impossible not to also be
              in awe.
              <br /><br />
              I think this is one of my favorite narrators of all time. He has
              such a genuine, innocent way of seeing the world it almost made me
              cry. His monologue was so endearing in the sincerity of his
              thoughts and the pure wonder and respect he held his world in.
              When he was at the fawn statue and believed it was saying "Hush!
              Be comforted!" to him my heart broke. And the way he described
              putting pretty shells and bones in his hair was so!!!!!
              <br /><br />
              Awhile ago when I was reading about Hegel, one intro to an essay
              emphasized that in ancient times thinking and philosophy was
              centered on how man fits into the universe. Actually how
              everything is slotted together. And as we've moved into modern
              times the thinking has gone to (strayed to?) man as the
              individual; he is a universe in and of himself. These historical
              shifts in thinking play a large part in the narrator's journey. In
              the House he is amongst endless nature and literal classical
              marble statues, he is entwined with the world and believes that as
              he cares for it, it cares for him - man and universe working in
              harmony.
              <br />
              <br />
              "the Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its kindness infinite"

            <h3>As I Lay Dying ~ William Faulkner</h3>
            <h4>Oct 10, 2023</h4>
            <p>
              Wow... Ok for context my americana obsession would inevitably go
              down that sprawling road towards Faulkner. It’s just a shame it
              took this long. From the opening the book is imbued with dread. It
              gave me the same feeling as reading And Then There Were None – the
              anticipation of watching everyone drop like flies. I can
              definitely see how Cormac McCarthy was influenced by Faulkner –
              obviously genre-wise but also a style of writing I describe as
              fill in the gap. Like describing events and scenes through
              snapshots and feelings rather than linearly. Leaves lots of room
              in between which gets very confusing and abstract and so fun to
              read.
              <br />
              <br />
              The style leans especially well to action, particularly the scene
              where Jewel is mounting his horse: it’s as if you’re supposed to
              read through the passage quickly and not linger on details to
              really /feel/ the movement, like stepping back from a Pollock.
              <br /><br />
              And the voices, god so strange and spiraling and serpentine but
              not pushed too hard to caricature. A lot of the times reading this
              book it’s like my senses know what’s going on before my mind.
              Which ig is one of the boons of stream of consciousness. And it
              was fun to interpret how everyone grieved thru the lens of like 10
              other people. I could go on about the themes but I can’t put my
              thoughts into words rn.
